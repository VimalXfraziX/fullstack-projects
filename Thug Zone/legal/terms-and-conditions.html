      <h2>Services Details</h2>
      <p>
        Thug Zone offers a platform dedicated to organizing championships or
        tournaments and related events for the games such as free fire and
        Battlegrounds Mobile India. Users can participate in and watch these

      <h2>Payment Terms</h2>
      <p>
        Want to join the epic battles on Thug Zone? Awesome! Here's the
        lowdown on payments:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Each event has its own price tag. You'll see the cost when you sign
          up.
        </li>
        <li>
          We've got different ways to pay. Check out the options on the event
          page.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sometimes we run special deals or discounts. Keep an eye out for
          those!
        </li>
        <li>
          If you're under 18, make sure you've got permission to use that
          payment method.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We know money stuff can be confusing, so we've tried to keep things
        simple. But if you're scratching your head over anything, just give us
        a shout. We're here to help!
      </p>

      <p>
        Remember, once you've paid and the event starts, we usually can't give
        refunds. It's like buying a ticket to a Free Fire or BGMI tournament -
        once it's on, it's on!
      </p>

      <p>
        By paying for an event, you're agreeing to our payment rules. Don't
        worry, we're not trying to trick you. We just want to make sure
        everyone's on the same page before the gaming begins!
      </p>

      <p>

      <h2>Intellectual Property Ownership</h2>
      <p>
        Thug Zone retains all rights, titles, and interests in its
        intellectual property, including but not limited to trademarks, logos,
        game content, website contents or texts and website assets. Please

      <h2>Limitations of Liability</h2>

      <p>
        We work hard to keep Thug Zone running smoothly, but sometimes stuff
        happens. Here's the deal on what we can and can't be responsible for:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>If you lose game progress, that's not on us.</li>
        <li>
          Same goes for any money you might lose because the site was down
          when you wanted to join a tournament.
        </li>
        <li>
          We can't be held responsible if your data gets messed up or if you
          can't use the site for a while.
        </li>
        <li>
          If something on our site causes problems for you or your device,
          we'll may take some actions about it.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Basically, we're not liable for any unexpected problems or losses you
        might face while using Thug Zone. It's like when your internet cuts
        out during a crucial Free Fire or BGMI match - frustrating, but not
        the game's fault.
      </p>

      <p>
        We're saying this because we have to, legally speaking. But don't
        worry - we still care about your experience. If something goes wrong,
        let us know. We might not be able to fix everything, but we'll always
        try to help if we can.
      </p>

      <p>
        Remember, gaming is about having fun and overcoming challenges. We're
        in this together, even when things get glitchy!
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Settling Disagreements</h2>

      <p>
        Look, we hope everything goes smoothly, but sometimes things can get
        tricky. If we ever end up in a disagreement about these terms or how
        you use Thug Zone, here's what you need to know:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          We'll handle things according to Indian law. It's our home turf,
          after all.
        </li>
        <li>
          If it comes down to legal stuff (which we really hope it doesn't),
          it'll happen in Indian courts.
        </li>
        <li>
          By using Thug Zone, you're agreeing to this setup. It's like picking
          a neutral map for a showdown.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We're not trying to be tough guys here. It's just important to have
        clear rules, kind of like in Free Fire or BGMI. We'd much rather solve
        any problems by talking it out, gamer to gamer.
      </p>

      <p>
        If something's bugging you, reach out to us first. We're pretty good
        at finding solutions that work for everyone. Let's keep things
        friendly, just like we do in our gaming community!
      </p>

      <h2>Cookies and Your Gaming Experience</h2>

      <p>
        At Thug Zone, we want you to have the best time possible when you
        visit us. To make that happen, we use small files called cookies.
        These aren't the kind you eat – they're digital helpers that remember
        things about your visit.
      </p>

      <h3>What do cookies do for you?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          They keep track of your game progress, registration progress etc.,
          so you don't lose your data
        </li>
        <li>
          They remember your preferences, like your favorite game modes or
          tournament settings
        </li>
        <li>
          They make logging in easier by saving some of your details (don't
          worry, we keep the important stuff safe)
        </li>
        <li>
          They help us understand how gamers use our site, so we can make it
          even better
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        By hanging out on Thug Zone, you're okay with us using these cookies.
        If you want to know more about how we handle your info, check out our
        privacy policy – it's not the most exciting read, but it's important!
      </p>

      <p>
        Just so you know, some of our partners (like ad companies or other
        gaming sites we work with) might use cookies too. We don't control
        those, but we trust them to follow the rules.
      </p>

      <p>
        If cookies aren't your thing, you can usually turn them off in your
        browser settings. But keep in mind, some parts of Thug Zone might not
        work as smoothly without them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Remember, we're all about fair play – in games and with your data. If
        you've got questions about cookies or anything else, just give us a
        shout. We're here to help!
